# Retail E-Commerce Backend (Practice Project)

Small Spring Boot project created for practice and interview preparation.

## Tech Stack

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Security + JWT
- MySQL
- Maven

## Modules

- Auth (register, login, JWT)
- Products (basic CRUD)
- Cart (add/clear)
- Orders (place order from cart)

This is not a production-ready application but good enough to discuss in interviews and extend further.
